To show that the subset of all functions $f(x)$ whose integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx = 0$ is a subspace, we need to show that $af(x)+bg(x)$ is in this subset, for any real numbers $a,b\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and functions $f(x), g(x)$ for which $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(x) \\, dx = 0$. Now using standard properties of integration\n",

Then there exist two vectors $v_1, v_2\\in V$, such that $u_1 = Av_1$ and $u_2 = Av_2$. Let's consider the linear combination $au_1 + bu_2$ for arbitrary scalars $a,b\\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then\n",

    "6. The intersection of two vector spaces, $S\\cap T$, *is* a vector space. Consider two vectors $u,v\\in S \\cap T$. Then $u,v\\in S$ and $u, v \\in T$. Consider a linear combination $au + bv$, where $a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $au+bv \\in S$, since $S$ is a vector space, and similarly $au+bv \\in T$ since $T$ is a vector space.
