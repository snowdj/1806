    "In linear algebra, it is critically important to **think about the shapes** (size) of matrices and vectors, and whether operations make sense.   You can multiply $AB$ if $A$ is $m \\times n$ ($m$ rows and $n$ columns) and $B$ is $n \\times p$ — the \"middle\" dimensions need to match up.  You can also add matrices of *equal* sizes, or multiply them by scalars.  Multiplying $Ax$, an $m \\times n$ matrix $A$ by an $n$-component vector, can be thought of as a special case of this rule if you think of $x$ as an $n \\times 1$ \"matrix\".  On exams, it is common for people to panic and start writing down nonsense, and an easy way to catch this is to make sure that the operations you are writing down **have the correct shapes**.\n",

    "1. $A^2$ is the product of two $(3\\times 4)$ matrices, which doesn't make sense because the middle dimensions (4 and 3) don't match. $AB$ is the product of $(3\\times4)$ and $(4\\times5)$ matrices, which makes sense because the middle dimensions (4) match, and so the result is a $3\\times5$ matrix. $BA$ is the product of a $(4\\times 5)$ and $(3\\times4)$ matrix, which doesn't make sense because the middle dimensions (5 and 3) don't match.\n",
    "2. $3x+A$ doesn't make sense. $3x$ is a $4\\times1$ matrix, while $A$ is a $3\\times 4$ matrix. They cannot be added. $3x+x$ makes sense. $3x$ and $x$ are both $4\\times1$ matrices, so the result is a $4\\times1$ matrix. ($3x+x=4x$).\n",
    "3. $Ax$ makes sense. It is a $3\\times1$ matrix (3 component column vector). $rA$ also makes sense. It is a $1\\times4$ matrix (4 component row vector). $Bx, Ar, Br, xA, xB, rB$ do not make sense.\n",
    "4. $xx$ and $rx$ do not make sense. However, $xr$ makes sense. It is a $4\\times 3$ matrix.\n",
